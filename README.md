Hi, My name is Mahdi Rasuli.
I am from Afghanistan, today I've just started to make my new project, which is called odin-recipe.
I started off learning the most basic html elements and now I wanna see things that I've learned so far in action.
Now that I started to know more about web developing and coding languages, I wanna make my own website.
