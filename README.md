Hi, My name is Mahdi Rasuli.
I am from Afghanistan, today I've just started to make my new project, which is called odin-recipe.
I started off learning the most basic html elements and now I wanna see things that I've learned so far in action.
Now that I started to know more about web developing and coding languages, I wanna make my own website.
Now that I think about my first ever project, the best I gotta do is to finish my project as it could be.
Practicing things that I've learned along the way, will help me remember what I've learned.
